This is a cnn model based on nvidia's model DAVE2

Download Dataset by Sully Chen: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view] Size: 25 minutes = 25{min} x 60{1 min = 60 sec} x 30{fps} = 45,000 images ~ 2.3 GB

Also I provide a Resnet model based on Dronet which got better performance
